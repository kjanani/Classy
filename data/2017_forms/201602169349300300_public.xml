      <Desc>ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH (ADR) - BRIGHTFOCUS' ADR PROGRAM FUNDS RESEARCH FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE'S CAUSES, ITS EARLY DETECTION, AND TREATMENTS TO HELP SLOW OR STOP ITS PROGRESSION, AND ULTIMATELY TO PREVENT THE DISEASE ALTOGETHER. ADR ANNUALLY AWARDS PEER-REVIEWED GRANTS TO SCIENTISTS FROM INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE WHO ARE CONDUCTING BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH ON ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2016, ADR FUNDED 30 NEW PROJECTS, TOTALING $6,504,817, AND AWARDED $342,500 IN TWO SPECIAL PROJECTS THAT FOCUS ON BETTER USE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES AND BIG DATA, TO INCREASE THE SPEED OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND RESEARCH PROGRESS. SINCE INCEPTION, BRIGHTFOCUS HAS CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN $100 MILLION TO THE CONQUERING OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC PROJECTS ARE INCLUDED IN SCHEDULES F &amp; I. BRIGHTFOCUS IS HONORED TO HAVE SUPPORTED THE EARLY RESEARCH OF TWO EVENTUAL NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS: DR. STANLEY PRUSINER AND DR. PAUL GREENGARD, WHOSE WORK HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL TO OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. FURTHER ILLUSTRATING BRIGHTFOCUS' IMPACT, A THIRD-PARTY ROSTER OF PAPERS THAT CONSIDERED MILESTONES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE LISTS 19 BRIGHTFOCUS-SUPPORTED PAPERS, SIX PERCENT OF THE TOTAL RECOGNIZED. BRIGHTFOCUS CONTINUES ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ACADEMIC JOURNAL "MOLECULAR NEURODEGENERATION" AS THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE BRIGHTFOCUS FOUNDATION. THE JOURNAL PUBLISHES TECHNICAL PAPERS RELATED TO NEURODEGENERATION IN THE THREE DISEASE AREAS. AS AN "OPEN ACCESS" JOURNAL, THERE IS NO FEE FOR READERS, AND ALL CONTENT IS FREE OF CHARGE AND EASY TO ACCESS. THIS OPEN ACCESS ENSURES MAXIMAL REACH OF JOURNAL CONTENTS TO SCIENTISTS AND CARE PROVIDERS WORLDWIDE. MOLECULAR NEURODEGENERATION IS CURRENTLY THE HIGHEST IMPACT OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL IN THE NEUROSCIENCES.ADR-SUPPORTED RESEARCH CONTINUED TO MAKE THE NEWS IN THIS FISCAL YEAR, INCLUDING HIGH VISIBILITY REPORTS RELATING TO DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW CLASS OF ANTI-ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE DRUGS, INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH BRIDGING ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHER CONDITIONS, AND MANY OTHER TOPICS. EACH AREA OF RESEARCH IS THE SUBJECT OF ONGOING BRIGHTFOCUS FUNDED RESEARCH STUDIES. MORE DETAILS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE NEWS UPDATES SECTION OF THE BRIGHTFOCUS.ORG WEBSITE.IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH PROVIDES EXCELLENT RESOURCES ON DETECTING, TREATING, AND LIVING WITH THE DISEASE. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IS THE ONLY CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG THE TOP 10 IN AMERICA WITHOUT A WAY TO PREVENT, CURE, OR EVEN SLOW ITS PROGRESSION. IT IS AN IRREVERSIBLE DEGENERATION OF THE BRAIN THAT CAUSES DISRUPTIONS IN MEMORY, COGNITION, PERSONALITY, AND OTHER FUNCTIONS AND INEVITABLY LEADS TO DEATH. MORE THAN 5 MILLION AMERICANS AGED 65 AND OLDER ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE TODAY, AND THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO TRIPLE BY MIDCENTURY.</Desc>

        <Desc>MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH (MDR)- A PROGRAM OF BRIGHTFOCUS, HAS AWARDED MORE THAN $21.5 MILLION TO SCIENTISTS STUDYING THE DISEASE. THE LATEST RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR THE DISEASE, UNDERSTANDING ITS CAUSES AND PROGRESSION, DRUG THERAPIES, AND NEW SCREENING TECHNIQUES.DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2016, MDR AWARDED $2,944,963 IN PEER-REVIEWED GRANT AWARDS TO 19 NEW RESEARCH PROJECTS AND $100,000 TO A SPECIAL PROJECT THAT RANGE FROM STUDIES TO DEVELOP NEW ANTI-OXIDANT BASED THERAPIES TO CLINICAL PROJECTS TESTING ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC STRATEGIES. ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT SPECIFIC PROJECTS ARE INCLUDED IN SCHEDULES F &amp; I. MDR-FUNDED PROJECTS WERE FEATURED IN MEDIA ARTICLES, INCLUDING PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW THERAPIES, AND INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH COMBINING AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) KNOWLEDGE WITH VASCULAR BIOLOGY TO DISCOVER NEW TREATMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MACULAR DEGENERATION. MORE DETAILS ON THIS AND OTHER SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES ACHIEVED THROUGH MDR FUNDING ARE AVAILABLE IN THE NEWS UPDATES SECTION OF THE BRIGHTFOCUS.ORG WEBSITE.IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH, MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH PROVIDES EXCELLENT RESOURCES ON DETECTING, TREATING, AND LIVING WITH THIS DISEASE. AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION IS A LEADING CAUSE OF VISION LOSS IN THE UNITED STATES. IT DESTROYS THE MACULA, THE PART OF THE EYE THAT PROVIDES SHARP, CENTRAL VISION NEEDED FOR SEEING OBJECTS CLEARLY. THE MOST COMMON EYE CONDITION IN PEOPLE AGE 60 AND OLDER, IT CAN LEAD TO VISION LOSS IN ONE OR BOTH EYES, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE FACES, DRIVE A CAR, OR READ.</Desc>

        <Desc>NATIONAL GLAUCOMA RESEARCH (NGR)- BRIGHTFOCUS' NATIONAL GLAUCOMA RESEARCH (NGR) PROGRAM HAS AWARDED MORE THAN $28.6 MILLION WORLDWIDE FOR THE STUDY OF GLAUCOMA. NGR-SUPPORTED RESEARCH HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE EYE-BRAIN CONNECTION, THE MECHANISMS FOR PRESSURE BUILDUP IN THE EYE, PREVENTING DAMAGE TO THE OPTIC NERVE, AND UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE GENES PLAY IN ORDER TO DEVELOP EARLY GLAUCOMA SCREENING AND TARGETED TREATMENTS. NGR GRANTS ARE AVAILABLE TO GLAUCOMA RESEARCHERS WORLDWIDE. NGR PLACES SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON ENCOURAGING APPLICATIONS FROM YOUNG SCIENTISTS AND THOSE WITH CUTTING-EDGE IDEAS. ANNUAL GRANT APPLICATIONS ARE PEER-REVIEWED, AND RECIPIENT SELECTIONS ARE BASED ON SCIENTIFIC MERIT. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2016, NGR AWARDED $1,874,555 FOR 13 NEW PROJECTS THAT RANGE FROM CALCULATING INDIVIDUAL RISK FOR GLAUCOMA TO REAL-TIME MONITORING AND CONTROL OF PRESSURE IN THE EYE, A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR FOR GLAUCOMA ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT SPECIFIC PROJECTS ARE INCLUDED IN SCHEDULES F &amp; I.NGR-FUNDED RESEARCH WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE MEDIA THIS YEAR, INCLUDING AN NGR-SUPPORTED STRATEGY TO IMPROVING GENE THERAPY OPPORTUNITIES IN GLAUCOMA. MORE DETAILS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE NEWS UPDATES SECTION OF THE BRIGHTFOCUS.ORG WEBSITE.IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH, NATIONAL GLAUCOMA RESEARCH PROVIDES EXCELLENT RESOURCES ON DETECTING, TREATING, AND LIVING WITH THE DISEASE. GLAUCOMA IS A GROUP OF DISEASES THAT DAMAGE THE EYE'S OPTIC NERVE AND CAN RESULT IN VISION LOSS AND PERMANENT BLINDNESS. MORE THAN 3 MILLION AMERICANS AGE 40 AND OLDER HAVE GLAUCOMA. MORE THAN 60 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HAVE THE DISEASE, AND THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY AS MUCH AS 20 MILLION BY 2020. WITH EARLY DETECTION AND TREATMENT, GLAUCOMA OFTEN CAN BE MANAGED TO PROTECT EYES FROM MORE SERIOUS VISION LOSS, BUT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ONLY HALF OF THE PEOPLE LIVING WITH GLAUCOMA ARE AWARE THAT THEY HAVE THE DISEASE.</Desc>

        <ExplanationTxt>BRIGHTFOCUS INTERACTS WITH ALL GRANTEES AT LEAST QUARTERLY BY E-MAIL OR AT SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS. IN ADDITION TO THESE INTERACTIONS, EACH GRANT RECIPIENT IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT SEPARATE DETAILED ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS AND FINANCIAL REPORTS TO BRIGHTFOCUS. THESE ARE RECEIVED BY THE BRIGHTFOCUS SCIENTIFIC AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT, AND REVIEWED BY SCIENTIFIC STAFF WITH BROAD EXPERTISE IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, CELL BIOLOGY, BIOCHEMISTRY, IMAGING AND GENETICS. SENIOR STAFF REVIEWS EACH PROGRESS REPORT AND EVALUATES THE PROJECT FOR SUFFICIENT PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SPECIFIC AIMS PROPOSED IN THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION OR ANY BUDGETARY CONCERNS. THIS EFFORT IS SUPPORTED BY ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC COUNSEL FROM MEMBERS OF THE BRIGHTFOCUS SCIENTIFIC REVIEW COMMITTEES, WHEN REQUIRED. IN ADDITION TO STATEMENTS OF EXPERIMENTAL PROGRESS, ALL GRANTEES ARE ASKED TO REPORT ANY TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS, MEDIA REPORTS, OR PATENT APPLICATIONS IN WHICH BRIGHTFOCUS-SPONSORED RESEARCH IS DESCRIBED. IF SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS RELATED TO PROGRESS ON THE AWARDS ARE DISCOVERED, AND NOT RESOLVED AFTER INTERACTION WITH THE AWARD GRANTEE, THE BRIGHTFOCUS STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS SCIENTIFIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GRANT AGREEMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, BRIGHTFOCUS MAY WITHHOLD FUNDING, OR DISCONTINUE AN AWARD, FOR ANY GRANTEE THAT FAILS TO ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT PROGRESS OR SUBMIT REQUIRED REPORTS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE GRANT AWARD PERIOD, EACH GRANTEE MUST COMPLETE AND SUBMIT A FINAL REPORT THAT IS ALSO REVIEWED BY THE BRIGHTFOCUS SENIOR SCIENTIFIC STAFF. EVALUATION OF THE WORK OF EACH GRANTEE IS QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY ASSESSED THROUGH VARIOUS METRICS RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF THE GRANT ON ITS TARGETED DISEASE FIELD. SUCH IMPACT METRICS HAVE REVEALED THAT 95% OF BRIGHTFOCUS-SUPPORTED RESEARCH RESULTS IN RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS THAT ADVANCE THE FIELDS SERVED BY BRIGHTFOCUS. THIS IMPACT IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY ANNUAL CITATION ANALYSIS THAT COMPARES BRIGHTFOCUS-SUPPORTED WORKS TO A STATISTICAL SAMPLE OF WORKS SUPPORTED BY EITHER THE US FEDERAL GVERNMENT OR THAT OF OTHER FUNDING AGENCIES. BRIGHTFOCUS-SUPPORTED PUBLICATIONS ARE CONSISTENTLY CITED AT NEARLY TWICE THE FREQUENCY OF ANY OTHER COMPARISON GROUP. A FINAL EXAMPLE OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVEALED THAT THE SUCCESSES OF BRIGHTFOCUS GRANTEES CONTINUE LONG AFTER THE GRANT EXPIRES. ON AVERAGE, EACH GRANTEE RECEIVES 2.2 ADDITIONAL GRANTS FOR PROJECTS SPAWNED BY THE BRIGHTFOCUS GRANT. THESE COME AT VALUES NEARLY 10 TIMES THE LEVEL OF THE INITIAL BRIGHTFOCUS INVESTMENT. BRIGHTFOCUS SOLICITS FEEDBACK FROM ITS GRANTEES, AND PROVIDES AN ANONYMOUS FORUM FOR COLLECTING SUCH INFORMATION. THROUGHOUT OUR WEBSITE AND WITHIN THE FINAL SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS REPORT, THERE ARE DESIGNATED SECTIONS WHERE AWARDEES ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THE FOUNDATION. THROUGH THIS MECHANISM, THEY ARE GIVEN THE ABILITY TO ANONYMOUSLY PROVIDE FEEDBACK OR COMMUNICATE THEIR CONCERNS TO PROGRAM STAFF OR THE BRIGHTFOCUS' COMPLIANCE OFFICE. ANY SUGGESTIONS, CONCERNS, COMPLAINTS, OR POSITIVE EXPERIENCES CAN BE OUTLINED AND BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF BRIGHTFOCUS IN THIS MANNER, SO WE MAY ADDRESS ANY AREAS NEEDING IMPROVEMENT, REAFFIRM PRAISE-WORTHY POLICIES, OR OTHERWISE ASSESS NEEDS FOR PROGRAMMATIC CHANGE. THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP PRESENTS AND SUMMARIZES THE STATUS AND PROGRESS ON GRANTS TO THE BRIGHTFOCUS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT EACH OF THEIR QUARTERLY BOARD MEETINGS.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>BRIGHTFOCUS INTERACTS WITH ALL GRANTEES AT LEAST QUARTERLY BY E-MAIL OR AT SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS. IN ADDITION TO THESE INTERACTIONS, EACH GRANT RECIPIENT IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT SEPARATE DETAILED ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS AND FINANCIAL REPORTS TO BRIGHTFOCUS. THESE ARE RECEIVED BY THE BRIGHTFOCUS SCIENTIFIC AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT, AND REVIEWED BY SCIENTIFIC STAFF WITH BROAD EXPERTISE IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, CELL BIOLOGY, BIOCHEMISTRY, IMAGING AND GENETICS. SENIOR STAFF REVIEWS EACH PROGRESS REPORT AND EVALUATES THE PROJECT FOR SUFFICIENT PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SPECIFIC AIMS PROPOSED IN THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION OR ANY BUDGETARY CONCERNS. THIS EFFORT IS SUPPORTED BY ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC COUNSEL FROM MEMBERS OF THE BRIGHTFOCUS SCIENTIFIC REVIEW COMMITTEES, WHEN REQUIRED. IN ADDITION TO STATEMENTS OF EXPERIMENTAL PROGRESS, ALL GRANTEES ARE ASKED TO REPORT ANY TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS, MEDIA REPORTS, OR PATENT APPLICATIONS IN WHICH BRIGHTFOCUS-SPONSORED RESEARCH IS DESCRIBED. IF SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS RELATED TO PROGRESS ON THE AWARDS ARE DISCOVERED, AND NOT RESOLVED AFTER INTERACTION WITH THE AWARD GRANTEE, THE BRIGHTFOCUS STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS SCIENTIFIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GRANT AGREEMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, BRIGHTFOCUS MAY WITHHOLD FUNDING, OR DISCONTINUE AN AWARD, FOR ANY GRANTEE THAT FAILS TO ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT PROGRESS OR SUBMIT REQUIRED REPORTS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE GRANT AWARD PERIOD, EACH GRANTEE MUST COMPLETE AND SUBMIT A FINAL REPORT THAT IS ALSO REVIEWED BY THE BRIGHTFOCUS SENIOR SCIENTIFIC STAFF. EVALUATION OF THE WORK OF EACH GRANTEE IS QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY ASSESSED THROUGH VARIOUS METRICS RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF THE GRANT ON ITS TARGETED DISEASE FIELD. SUCH IMPACT METRICS HAVE REVEALED THAT 95% OF BRIGHTFOCUS-SUPPORTED RESEARCH RESULTS IN RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS THAT ADVANCE THE FIELDS SERVED BY BRIGHTFOCUS. THIS IMPACT IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY ANNUAL CITATION ANALYSIS THAT COMPARES BRIGHTFOCUS-SUPPORTED WORKS TO A STATISTICAL SAMPLE OF WORKS SUPPORTED BY EITHER THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THAT OF OTHER FUNDING AGENCIES. BRIGHTFOCUS-SUPPORTED PUBLICATIONS ARE CONSISTENTLY CITED AT NEARLY TWICE THE FREQUENCY OF ANY OTHER COMPARISON GROUP. A FINAL EXAMPLE OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVEALED THAT THE SUCCESSES OF BRIGHTFOCUS GRANTEES CONTINUE LONG AFTER THE GRANT EXPIRES. ON AVERAGE, EACH GRANTEE RECEIVES 2.2 ADDITIONAL GRANTS FOR PROJECTS SPAWNED BY THE BRIGHTFOCUS GRANT. THESE COME AT VALUES NEARLY 10 TIMES THE LEVEL OF THE INITIAL BRIGHTFOCUS INVESTMENT. BRIGHTFOCUS SOLICITS FEEDBACK FROM ITS GRANTEES, AND PROVIDES AN ANONYMOUS FORUM FOR COLLECTING SUCH INFORMATION. THROUGHOUT OUR WEBSITE AND WITHIN THE FINAL SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS REPORT, THERE ARE DESIGNATED SECTIONS WHERE AWARDEES ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THE FOUNDATION. THROUGH THIS MECHANISM, THEY ARE GIVEN THE ABILITY TO ANONYMOUSLY PROVIDE FEEDBACK OR COMMUNICATE THEIR CONCERNS TO PROGRAM STAFF OR THE BRIGHTFOCUS' COMPLIANCE OFFICE. ANY SUGGESTIONS, CONCERNS, COMPLAINTS, OR POSITIVE EXPERIENCES CAN BE OUTLINED AND BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF BRIGHTFOCUS IN THIS MANNER, SO WE MAY ADDRESS ANY AREAS NEEDING IMPROVEMENT, REAFFIRM PRAISE-WORTHY POLICIES, OR OTHERWISE ASSESS NEEDS FOR PROGRAMMATIC CHANGE. THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP PRESENTS AND SUMMARIZES THE STATUS AND PROGRESS ON GRANTS TO THE BRIGHTFOCUS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT EACH OF THEIR QUARTERLY BOARD MEETINGS.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>BRIGHTFOCUS FOUNDATION (BRIGHTFOCUS) SEEKS TO SAVE MIND AND SIGHT BY FUNDING INNOVATIVE RESEARCH WORLDWIDE AND BY PROMOTING BETTER HEALTH THROUGH EDUCATION. WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON THREE INCURABLE DISEASES AFFECTING MIND AND SIGHT: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, MACULAR DEGENERATION, AND GLAUCOMA. COLLECTIVELY, 1 IN 16 PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 40 IN THE U.S. ALONE HAS ONE OF THESE DISEASES. BRIGHTFOCUS HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF SUPPORTING THE MOST INNOVATIVE, EARLY-STAGE RESEARCH SEEKING BETTER UNDERSTANDING, TREATMENTS, OR, ULTIMATELY, A CURE FOR THESE DISEASES. SINCE 1973, BRIGHTFOCUS HAS AWARDED MORE THAN $150 MILLION IN RESEARCH GRANTS TO THOUSANDS OF SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD. OUR RESEARCH FUNDING HAS LED TO MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THESE DISEASES AND TO THE AWARDING OF TWO NOBEL PRIZES. BRIGHTFOCUS-SUPPORTED FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENTLY CITED BY OTHER SCIENTISTS AT TWICE THE FREQUENCY AS OTHER RESEARCH FINDINGS. OUR FUNDING ACTS AS A CATALYST IN EARLY-STAGE RESEARCH. THE BRIGHTFOCUS RESEARCH PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INITIAL FUNDING FOR HIGHLY INNOVATIVE EXPERIMENTAL IDEAS. DUE TO THE STRUCTURED GRANT REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS, THE RESEARCH IMPACT OF BRIGHTFOCUS IS VERY HIGH. MOST RECIPIENTS OF BRIGHTFOCUS FUNDING GO ON TO RECEIVE FUTURE GRANTS FROM OTHER SOURCES THAT ARE 10 TIMES LARGER THAN THE ORIGINAL BRIGHTFOCUS AWARD. THIS ONE THOUSAND PERCENT RETURN ON BRIGHTFOCUS INVESTMENT SPEAKS TO OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY PROMISING RESEARCH IN ITS EARLIEST STAGES AND SPAWN FUTURE SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES. IT IS OUR FIRM BELIEF THAT HAVING THE COURAGE TO INVEST IN INNOVATIVE IDEAS WILL LEAD TO REVOLUTIONARY APPROACHES AND LIFE-SAVING BREAKTHROUGHS. INDISPUTABLY, THE WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH IDENTIFIED AND SUPPORTED BY BRIGHTFOCUS IS MORE THAN PROMISING: IT IS MAKING A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO REVOLUTIONARY SCIENCE IN THE FIGHT TO SAVE MIND AND SIGHT. ALONG WITH FUNDING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH TO FIND CURES TO SOME OF SOCIETY'S COSTLIEST DISEASES, BRIGHTFOCUS ALSO PROVIDES FREE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND SUPPORT TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS AND FAMILIES AFFECTED BY THESE DISEASES NATIONWIDE. WE BASE THESE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS OFF OF THE LATEST RESEARCH FINDINGS. BRIGHTFOCUS INCREASES PUBLIC AWARENESS OF ALZHEIMER'S, MACULAR DEGENERATION, AND GLAUCOMA, AND COMMUNICATES WITH THOUGHT LEADERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN THESE AREAS. BRIGHTFOCUS' AWARD-WINNING PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS (PSA) HAVE APPEARED ON TELEVISION, RADIO, AND IN PRINT THROUGHOUT THE NATION. BOTH MAKE A PLAN TODAY: GET YOUR EYES CHECKED AND NOW IS THE MOMENT TO STOP ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE POWERFULLY SEEK TO RAISE AWARENESS AND EARLY DETECTION. SIMILAR MESSAGES HAVE BEEN DELIVERED THROUGH DONATED PRINT PSA SPACE IN AIRPORTS AND TRAIN STATIONS, AS WELL AS AT PHARMACIES AND SUPERMARKETS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, THESE PSA MESSAGES GENERATED $13,318,687 IN DONATED MEDIA SERVICES AND GARNERED 1.3 BILLION IMPRESSIONS. STARTING IN FEBRUARY 2014, WE LAUNCHED BRIGHTFOCUS CHATS, A FREE, INTERACTIVE MONTHLY TELEPHONE FORUM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS TO LEARN FROM, AND ASK QUESTIONS OF, LEADING RESEARCHERS AND SPECIALISTS ON VISION DISEASES. THE CHATS ARE ARCHIVED ON OUR WEB SITE, WITH AUDIO AND PRINT TRANSCRIPTS AVAILABLE IN A NUMBER OF ACCESSIBLE FORMATS. WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR PRINT PUBLICATIONS, MANY IN SPANISH, THAT PROVIDE HELPFUL INFORMATION TO PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS, AND REGULARLY UNVEIL NEW VIDEO AND AUDIO RESOURCES IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALLIES IN THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR WRITTEN CONTENT OF KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS, PROMOTING AND SHARING THIS INFORMATION THROUGH OUR WEB SITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. CAPITALIZING ON EMERGING USE OF DATA VISUALIZATION, OUR BRIGHTFOCUS "SNAPSHOT" SERIES GRAPHICALLY COMMUNICATES INFORMATION ON ALZHEIMER'S, MACULAR DEGENERATION, AND GLAUCOMA. THROUGH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA AND WEB RESOURCES, WE CONDUCT CONTESTS AND PROMOTIONS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF THESE DISEASES AND FURTHER SHARE BRIGHTFOCUS PUBLICATIONS AND EVENTS. A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IS OUR HEALTHY RECIPE CONTEST, WHICH DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTIVE LIFESTYLE CHOICES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, EACH OF THESE PROGRAM AREAS MAIL AWARENESS-RAISING MATERIALS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS, WITH MESSAGES FOCUSING ON: RISK FACTORS AND SYMPTOM RECOGNITION THROUGH PUBLIC AWARENESS AND STEPS THE PUBLIC SHOULD TAKE THAT MAY HELP REDUCE THEIR RISK. LIFESTYLE CHOICES THAT PROMOTE GOOD HEALTH, ENCOURAGING READERS TO TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE ONSET OF THE DISEASE. RESEARCH RESULTS AND TREATMENTS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE DISEASE. BRIGHTFOCUS REGULARLY INTERACTS WITH MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA, AS WELL AS ELECTED OFFICIALS AND FEDERAL AGENCY STAFF. TWICE IN THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE BEEN INVITED PRESENTERS AT U.S. CAPITOL BRIEFINGS FOR CONGRESSIONAL STAFF.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM (RAS) IS A BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAY PRIMARILY INVOLVED IN BLOOD PRESSURE REGULATION, BUT WHICH BECOMES OVERACTIVE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD). PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT SOME COMMONLY PRESCRIBED ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE DRUGS THAT ALSO WORK IN THE RAS SYSTEM CAN PROTECT AGAINST RATES OF ALZHEIMER'S IN PEOPLE, AND ALSO AGAINST CELL AND BRAIN TISSUE DAMAGE, AS WELL AS COGNITIVE DECLINE, IN ANIMAL MODELS OF AD. WE HAVE JUST FOUND THAT AN IMPORTANT REGULATORY ARM OF RAS IS ALSO DEFECTIVE IN AD AND THAT REDUCED ACTIVITY OF THIS PATHWAY IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE EXTENSIVE PATHOLOGY IN HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE. OUR PROPOSED STUDY WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER ACTIVATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THIS REGULATORY PATHWAY, USING A DRUG ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR TESTING IN PEOPLE BUT PREVIOUSLY NOT CONSIDERED IN AD, CAN PROTECT AGAINST BOTH COGNITIVE DECLINE AND TISSUE DAMAGE NORMALLY SEEN IN AN ESTABLISHED MOUSE MODEL OF AD, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A NEW THERAPY THAT CAN MOVE RAPIDLY TO CLINICAL TRIAL TESTING FOR AD.

THE PATHOLOGY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ELEVATED IOP ASSOCIATED WITH GLAUCOMA LIES IN THE CONVENTIONAL AQUEOUS HUMOR OUTFLOW PATHWAY. SOMEWHAT REMARKABLY, NO CURRENT PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY FOR GLAUCOMA IS DIRECTED AT THIS PATHWAY. THE PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF NON-CODING RNAS ON THE NITRIC OXIDE SYSTEM AND THEIR POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT IN REGULATION OF THE CONVENTIONAL OUTFLOW PATHWAY. THE INVESTIGATION COULD LEAD TO A NEW THERAPEUTIC APPROACH THAT WOULD BE ADDITIVE TO CURRENT THERAPIES AND THEREBY USEFUL IN STABILIZING DISEASE PROGRESSION.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IS NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE TISSUES THAT MAKE UP OUR BODY TO KEEP US IN WORKING ORDER. HOWEVER, INFLAMMATION IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD, TOO MUCH CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE SURROUNDING TISSUES, TOO LITTLE CAN BE INEFFECTIVE AT INDUCING HEALING. TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE HAS EVOLVED SO THAT ONCE A PRO-INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IS GENERATED, IT PROMOTES THE EXPRESSION OF CHEMICALS THAT PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND SWITCH OFF INFLAMMATION BY INHIBITING THE VERY PRO-INFLAMMATORY SIGNALS THAT GENERATED THEM; IN THIS WAY, THE PROCESS OF INFLAMMATION PROGRAMS ITS OWN END. AMD HAS ELEMENTS THAT INDICATE THAT THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IS UNCONTROLLED AND PERSISTENT LOW-LEVEL INFLAMMATION IS OBSERVED. OUR RESEARCH QUESTION ASKS WHETHER THIS ACTIVE PROCESS OF SWITCHING OFF THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IS LOST IN PEOPLE WITH AMD.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: UNDERSTANDING THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS BY WHICH DEBRIS ACCUMULATES IN THE RETINA IN AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) IS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING DISEASE PATHWAYS AND ULTIMATELY DEVELOPING NOVEL TREATMENT TARGETS FOR EARLY AMD. AS PART OF THIS STUDY, WE WILL EVALUATE THE FUNCTION OF THESE CELLS IN A LABORATORY DISH AND COMPARE THE FUNCTION BETWEEN CELLS TAKEN FROM PEOPLE WITH AMD AND CELLS FROM PEOPLE WITHOUT AMD. ONCE SUBSTANTIATED, WE WILL HAVE IDENTIFIED A TRULY NOVEL MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF SEVERE VISION LOSS IN OUR COMMUNITY. THIS WILL CHANGE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIC MECHANISMS THAT LEAD TO THE EARLIEST CHANGES IN AMD AND ITS PROGRESSION TO VISION LOSS. IT HAS POTENTIAL TO OPEN AVENUES FOR TESTING NEW DRUGS THAT ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF THE FAULTY CELLS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, VISIT THE BRIGHTFOCUS WEBSITE: WWW.BRIGHTFOCUS.ORG/GRANT/M2016061.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF BLINDING AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) BUT TREATMENT IS ONLY CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR ONE OF THESE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NOVEL STATISTICAL TOOL AND HIGH THROUGHPUT COMPUTATIONAL MODEL THAT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT ALL GENES IN OUR GENOME AND IDENTIFY THOSE GENES THAT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER TO CAUSE BOTH OF THESE TYPES OF AMD. USING THE WORLD'S LARGEST COLLECTION OF AMD SAMPLES, DRAWN FROM MULTIPLE COHORTS OF 40,000 PEOPLE, WE WILL IDENTIFY THE IMPORTANT GENETIC INTERACTIONS IN EACH TYPE OF AMD.

SEVERAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT REDUCTION OF APP IS THERAPEUTICALLY BENEFICIAL IN AD MOUSE MODELS. THIS EVIDENCE PROMPTED US TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT MODEST REDUCTION IN THE LEVELS OF APP PROTEINS WOULD DELAY THE ONSET AND RETARD PROGRESSION OF DISEASE. WE PLAN TO IDENTIFY NEW THERAPEUTIC TARGETS USING AN UNBIASED, HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREEN USING TWO DIFFERENT ASSAY SYSTEMS IN PARALLEL (HUMAN NEURONAL CELL LINES AND FRUIT FLIES EXPRESSING HUMAN APP) TO IDENTIFY THOSE PROTEINS WHOSE REDUCTION RESULTS IN LOWER LEVELS OF APP, AND RESCUES NEURONAL DEGENERATION IN FLIES.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH BY BRENDAN LUCEY, MD ENTITLED: (A2016180S) SLEEP QUALITY AND HUMAN AMYLOID-BETA KINETICS. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: THE DEPOSITION OF AMYLOID-BETA PROTEIN (A-BETA) IN THE BRAIN IS A KEY FIRST STEP IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD). RECENT WORK HAS SHOWN THAT SLEEP DECREASES THE CONCENTRATION OF A-BETA IN THE BRAINS OF MICE AND HUMANS. IN MICE, DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF SLEEP BOTH REDUCED THE A-BETA CONCENTRATION AND DEPOSITION IN THE BRAIN SUGGESTING THAT SLEEP COULD BE A THERAPY TO PREVENT AD. KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN, HOWEVER, BEFORE AD PREVENTION TRIALS USING SLEEP CAN BEGIN. THIS STUDY PROPOSES TO ANSWER SEVERAL OF THESE QUESTIONS: 1) DOES POOR SLEEP QUALITY INCREASE A-BETA AND 2) DOES IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY IN POOR SLEEPERS DECREASE A-BETA?

ALTHOUGH IMAGING METHODS, SUCH AS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI), HAVE SHOWN PROMISE AT MEASURING CHANGES IN BRAIN STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND DEMENTIA, THESE APPROACHES ARE RELATIVELY INSENSITIVE TO THE EARLIEST DISEASE STAGES, WHEN TREATMENTS WILL LIKELY BE MOST EFFECTIVE. A NEW BRAIN IMAGING TECHNIQUE, RESTRICTION SPECTRUM IMAGING (RSI), HAS SHOWN PROMISE AT REVEALING SMALLER-SCALE FEATURES OF BRAIN STRUCTURE THAN STANDARD TECHNIQUES. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST WHETHER NEW RSI-BASED MEASURES CAN RESOLVE SMALL-SCALE PATHWAYS THOUGHT TO BE AFFECTED BY AD, ACCURATELY PREDICT WHICH INDIVIDUALS WILL DECLINE COGNITIVELY, AND CORRELATE WITH OTHER KNOWN MARKERS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) IS DEFINED BY THE PRESENCE OF AMYLOID PLAQUES AND TAU TANGLES IN THE BRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH MEMORY LOSS; HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH AD HAVE NON-MEMORY SYMPTOMS, SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR VISUOSPATIAL IMPAIRMENT. THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY OF THESE NON-AMNESTIC AD PATIENTS IS UNDERSTUDIED. FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENETIC INFLUENCE AND PROGRESSION OF TAU PATHOLOGY IN NON-AMNESTIC AD WILL IMPROVE THE DIAGNOSIS OF PATIENTS WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM EMERGING THERAPIES THAT AIM TO HALT OR SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF PLAQUES AND TANGLES IN THE BRAIN AND ALSO IDENTIFY NEW GENETIC TARGETS FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN AD.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH BY XIONG JIANG, PHD ENTITLED: (A2016251S) A NOVEL MULTIMODALITY MRI BIOMARKER OF ASYMPTOMATIC ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) IS A NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE AND THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DEMENTIA. WITH NO KNOWN CURES OR DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPIES, THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO FIND BIOMARKERS THAT CAN ACCURATELY ASSESS AND PREDICT DISEASE PROGRESSION IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS. HOWEVER, DESPITE RECENT EFFORTS AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN RESEARCH, FINDING SUCH A BIOMARKER REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. GIVEN THAT AD IS HYPOTHESIZED TO LEAD TO CHANGES IN NEURONAL FUNCTION LONG BEFORE DETECTABLE BEHAVIORAL IMPAIRMENTS AND/OR BRAIN STRUCTURE CHANGES, FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI), WITH ITS ABILITY TO IMAGE BRAIN FUNCTION, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A CRITICAL TOOL IN THE EARLY DETECTION OF AD AND A NON-INVASIVE TECHNIQUE THAT CAN BE USED IN THE EVALUATION OF TREATMENTS. HERE WE PROPOSE THAT A NOVEL INTRA-REGIONAL FMRI TECHNIQUE THAT WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DETECT AND QUANTIFY SUBTLE NEURONAL DYSFUNCTION WITHIN BRAIN AREAS OF CLINICAL INTEREST (I.E., THE HIPPOCAMPUS) AT EARLY STAGES OF DISEASE. HOWEVER, THIS TECHNIQUE FOCUSES ON DETECTING CHANGES WITHIN REGIONS OF GRAY MATTER, WHICH MAINLY CONSIST OF NEURONAL CELL BODIES AND BRANCHING DENDRITES, THUS SOME ASPECTS OF EARLY AD PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WITH THIS NOVEL INTRA-REGIONAL FMRI TECHNIQUE, INCLUDING DISRUPTED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN BRAIN REGIONS AND IMPAIRED INTEGRITY WITHIN WHITE MATTER, WHICH MAINLY RELATES TO NERVE FIBERS. THEREFORE, INTEGRATING THIS NOVEL FMRI TECHNIQUE WITH OTHER MRI MODALITIES IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN SENSITIVITY AND ACCURACY IN ASSESSING AD PROGRESSION. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY USING A COMBINATION OF THIS NOVEL FMRI TECHNIQUE WITH OTHER MRI TECHNIQUES, WITH AN ULTIMATE GOAL OF DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING A MULTIMODAL MRI BIOMARKER OF ASYMPTOMATIC AD THAT IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO EARLY AD PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES AND CAN ACCURATELY DETECT AND ASSESS AD PROGRESSION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE WILL ENROLL INDIVIDUALS WITH AMNESTIC MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (AMCI), COGNITIVELY NORMAL (CN) INDIVIDUALS WITH GENETIC (APOE-4) AND FAMILY HISTORY RISK, AND CN INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT EITHER RISK FACTOR. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AD PROGRESSION AND MRI DATA OF EACH INDIVIDUAL MRI MODALITY WILL BE EXAMINED SEPARATELY (AIM 1).

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) SLOWLY PROGRESSES AS MORE AND MORE SYNAPSES IN THE BRAIN ARE DESTROYED. THIS FIRST CAUSES A GRADUAL DECLINE IN MEMORIES AND EVENTUALLY INEVITABLY LEADS TO DEMENTIA AND DEATH. EPHB RECEPTORS ARE IMPORTANT PROTEINS FOR SYNAPSE FUNCTION AND HEALTH, AS THEY HOLD HANDS WITH THE NMDA RECEPTOR PROTEIN TO HELP OUR BRAINS STORE MEMORIES. EPHB ALSO HAS THE UNFORTUNATE ABILITY TO HOLD HANDS WITH PLAQUE-FORMING AMYLOID-BETA (A-BETA) PEPTIDES MADE TO EVER INCREASING LEVELS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, AND THIS RISE IN A-BETA TARGETS EPHB FOR DEGRADATION, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN SYNAPSES AND MEMORIES. USING NOVEL HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENS OF SMALL DRUG-LIKE CHEMICAL LIBRARIES FOR COMPOUNDS THAT DISRUPT THE ABILITY OF EPHB TO BIND WITH A-BETA, I AIM TO DISCOVER A NEW CLASS OF MEDICINES THAT WILL HALT THE DESTRUCTION OF SYNAPSES AND AVERT MEMORY LOSS WITH DIRECT IMPLICATION FOR THE PREVENTION OF AD.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: ACCUMULATION OF ABNORMAL AMYLOID AND TAU PROTEINS IN THE BRAINS ARE BELIEVED TO BE DETRIMENTAL FOR BRAIN FUNCTIONS; THUS SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO REDUCE THESE BAD PROTEINS FROM THE BRAIN MAY HELP US FIND A PROMISING DRUG FOR AD. WE HAVE FOUND THAT A SMALL CHEMICAL MOLECULE CAN MAKE MICROGLIA, A SPECIAL BRAIN CELL WITH CAPABILITY TO CLEAN UP THESE BAD PROTEINS, AND HELP THEM WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY IN CLEARANCE OF AMYLOID PROTEINS. THIS PROJECT WILL PRODUCE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS SMALL CHEMICAL HELPS MICROGLIA CLEAN UP AMYLOID PROTEINS.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH BY RACHEL BENNETT, PHD ENTITLED: (A2016404F) BLOOD VESSEL CHANGES IN TAUOPATHY. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT TAU, A KEY PLAYER IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD), LEADS TO BLOOD VESSEL CHANGES AND INCREASED EXPRESSION OF PROTEINS INVOLVED IN NEW BLOOD VESSEL GROWTH IN THE BRAINS OF MICE. WE DO NOT KNOW IF THESE CHANGES CONTRIBUTE TO CELL DEATH AND ACCUMULATION OF AD PROTEINS. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO DETERMINE IF BLOOD VESSEL ALTERATIONS ARE AN EARLY OR LATE EVENT IN THE DISEASE PROCESS AND TO USE "OFF THE SHELF" DRUGS TO PREVENT BLOOD VESSEL GROWTH. ALTOGETHER, THESE STUDIES WILL DETERMINE IF THE OBSERVED CHANGES ARE HARMFUL AND MAY POINT TOWARDS WIDELY AVAILABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENTS.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: A ROBUST FEATURE OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) BRAIN PATHOLOGY IS THE ACCUMULATION OF LYSOSOMES (DIGESTIVE ORGANELLES OF CELLS) IN SWOLLEN NEURONAL AXONS THAT SURROUND AMYLOID PLAQUES. HOW THESE LYSOSOMES COME TO ACCUMULATE AND WHAT THEIR ROLE IS IN AD HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. WHILE A MAJOR FUNCTION OF LYSOSOMES IS TO DEGRADE PROTEINS, OUR RECENT WORK INVESTIGATING THESE PLAQUE-ASSOCIATED LYSOSOMES DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY LACK THE ENZYMES REQUIRED FOR EFFICIENT PROTEIN DEGRADATION. THIS SUGGESTS A MODEL WHEREIN AMYLOID PLAQUES CAUSE A BLOCKADE IN THE TRANSPORT AND MATURATION OF LYSOSOMES IN SURROUNDING NEURONAL AXONS. THESE IMMATURE LYSOSOMES APPEAR TO CONTAIN THE MACHINERY REQUIRED TO MAKE MORE OF THE AMYLOID BETA PEPTIDE THAT IS THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF AMYLOID PLAQUES. THUS, THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AMYLOID PLAQUES AND NEURONAL AXONS ARE PREDICTED TO RESULT IN A VICIOUS CYCLE THAT CONTRIBUTES TO FURTHER DISEASE PATHOLOGY. MY PROPOSED RESEARCH AIMS TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS COMPREHENSIVELY BY ESTABLISHING A NEURONAL PRIMARY CULTURE MODEL FOR SUCH AXONAL LYSOSOME TRANSPORT DEFECTS. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE AMENABLE TO DRUG MANIPULATIONS AND GENETIC PERTURBATIONS TO ELUCIDATE BOTH THE MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL LYSOSOME BIOGENESIS AND TRANSPORT IN NEURONAL AXONS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF IMPAIRED LYSOSOME TRANSPORT ON THE AMYLOIDOGENIC PROCESSING OF THE AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP). I WILL FURTHERMORE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF LYSOSOME AXONAL TRANSPORT DEFECTS ON AD BRAIN PATHOLOGY (SUCH AS AMYLOID PLAQUE GROWTH AND NUMBER) THROUGH THE USE OF GENETIC PERTURBATIONS IN A MOUSE MODEL OF AD.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: COMPLEMENT C3, AN IMMUNE MOLECULE THAT HELPS TO REFINE THE VISUAL SYSTEM DURING BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BY REMOVING WEAK NERVE CONNECTIONS CALLED "SYNAPSES" IS UP-REGULATED IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) AND THEREFORE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE SYNAPSE LOSS THAT UNDERLIES COGNITIVE DECLINE. WE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT AGED MICE LACKING C3 THROUGHOUT LIFE HAVE PRESERVED SYNAPSES AND BETTER MEMORY THAN NORMAL AGED MICE. TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND WHEN AND WHERE C3 PLAYS A ROLE IN AD, WE HAVE GENERATED TWO NOVEL MOUSE MODELS IN WHICH C3 GENE EXPRESSION CAN BE SHUT OFF AT ANY AGE BY INJECTION OF A CHEMICAL, OF DELETED IN SPECIFIC IMMUNE CELLS (ONLY) THROUGHOUT LIFE. FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION OF THESE MICE WILL BETTER DEFINE THE ROLE OF C3 IN THE AGING BRAIN AND AD AND MAY DIRECT US TO NEW THERAPIES.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: DRUG TRIALS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING STARTED IN AN EARLY STAGE OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) BEFORE MEMORY PROBLEMS START, TO PREVENT BRAIN DAMAGE FROM BECOMING TOO SEVERE. TO TEST HOW WELL SUCH A TREATMENT IS WORKING, WE NEED A GOOD MEASURE THAT CAN TRACK THE TREATMENT EFFECTS IN THE BRAIN. A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR THAT IS THE BRAIN REGION KNOWN AS THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE, BECAUSE IT IS AFFECTED IN AN EARLY STAGE OF AD. HOWEVER, A FACT THAT COMPLICATES USING THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE AS A MARKER IS THAT THIS BRAIN REGION IS ALSO AFFECTED IN NORMAL AGING. TO SEPARATE THE EFFECTS OF PRECLINICAL AD FROM NORMAL AGING, WE PLAN TO INVESTIGATE THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE WITH A MORE PRECISE, HIGH RESOLUTION MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING SCANNER, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO INVESTIGATE SMALLER REGIONS WITHIN THIS BRAIN REGION WHICH, IN CONTRAST TO THE CRUDER MEASUREMENTS, ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF AGING AND PRECLINICAL AD.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH BY JENNIFER GATCHEL, MD, PHD ENTITLED: (A2016434F) DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND TAU PET IMAGING IN EARLY ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD), CHANGES OCCUR NOT ONLY IN A PERSON'S MEMORY AND THINKING, BUT ALSO IN THEIR MOOD AND BEHAVIOR; SYMPTOMS SUCH AS DEPRESSION, APATHY AND WITHDRAWAL ARE COMMON AND DISTRESSING TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES, AND CAN BE JUST AS DEBILITATING, IF NOT MORE SO, THAN CHANGES IN MEMORY AND THINKING. THESE PSYCHIATRIC AND BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS MAY OCCUR VERY EARLY IN THE DISEASE PROCESS, IN THE "PRE-ALZHEIMER'S" DISEASE STAGE, WHEN A PERSON MAY HAVE THE AD PROTEINS, AMYLOID BETA (A-BETA) AND TAU, IN THEIR BRAINS, BUT BEFORE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED OVERT SIGNS OF THE DISEASE. THERE IS CURRENTLY NOT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY AND HOW THESE DEBILITATING PSYCHIATRIC AND BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS OCCUR, AND THERE ARE FEW EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS. VISUALIZING A-BETA IN THE BRAINS OF OLDER ADULTS, AND NOW, DUE TO AN EXCITING NEW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN OUR GROUP THAT WILL ALSO ALLOW US FOR THE FIRST TIME TO VISUALIZE THE TAU PROTEIN IN THE BRAINS OF LIVING OLDER ADULTS, THIS PROJECT WILL BE VITAL BY 1) ALLOWING US TO SEE HOW MILD PSYCHIATRIC AND BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS RELATE TO BUILD UP OF A-BETA, TAU, AND BRAIN PATHWAY CHANGES IN NORMAL OLDER ADULTS AND THOSE IN THE PRE-ALZHEIMER'S AND EARLY AD STAGES, AND 2) PROVIDING IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PATTERNS OF PSYCHIATRIC AND BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS THAT MAY HELP US TO IDENTIFY THOSE MOST AT RISK, ALL OF WHICH WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR DEVELOPING MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AND PREVENTION STRATEGIES FOR AD.

BECAUSE THERE IS AN URGENT, UNMET NEED FOR DRUGS TO TREAT BOTH THE SYMPTOMS AND THE DISEASE, THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL EXPLORE A NOVEL STRATEGY TO TREAT AD BY TARGETING A BIOLOGICAL PATHWAY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF ALL EXISTING DRUGS AND KNOWN CLINICAL CANDIDATES. IF SUCCESSFUL, A COMPOUND WILL BE IDENTIFIED THAT HOLDS PROMISE FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM AD, THUS REPRESENTING A NEW WAY TO TREAT THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE.

MOREOVER, A NUMBER OF BIOMARKER STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT VGF-DERIVED PEPTIDES IN THE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) ARE DECREASED IN PATIENTS WITH AD BUT NOT IN CONTROL PATIENTS. THESE DATA INDICATE THAT DECREASED VGF EXPRESSION IN THE BRAIN AND CSF IS ASSOCIATED WITH NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THIS DECLINE IS MECHANISTICALLY INVOLVED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OR PROGRESSION OF AD. IN PRECLINICAL STUDIES, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH VGF DELAYS OR REVERSES MEMORY DYSFUNCTION AND NEUROPATHOLOGY IN A MOUSE MODEL OF AD, AND LASTLY WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER A VGF-DERIVED PEPTIDE COULD BE THERAPEUTICALLY HARNESSED TO SUPPRESS MEMORY IMPAIRMENT IN THESE MICE, PROVIDING A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE EXPLORATION OF APPROACHES THAT DELIVER VGF AND/OR VGF-DERIVED PEPTIDES TO PATIENTS WITH AD.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: NORMAL PRESSURE INSIDE OF THE EYE IS MAINTAINED THROUGH A DYNAMIC BALANCE BETWEEN AQUEOUS HUMOR PRODUCTION AND DRAINAGE, AND HIGHER EYE PRESSURE IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA (POAG), A DISEASE THAT IS A LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS WORLDWIDE. FOR AQUEOUS HUMOR TO DRAIN OUT OF THE EYE, IT NEEDS TO EXIT THROUGH A TUBE, SCHLEMM'S CANAL (SC), AND TWO UNIQUE STRUCTURES CAN BE FOUND IN THE CELLS THAT LINE THE WALL OF SC: GIANT VACUOLES, WHICH ARE PRESSURE-DEPENDENT OUTPOUCHINGS, AND PORES, WHICH ARE OPENINGS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT A REDUCTION IN THE DENSITY OF BOTH GIANT VACUOLES AND PORES OCCURS IN THE EYES WITH POAG, INDICATING THAT THIS REDUCTION CAN POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELEVATED OUTFLOW RESISTANCE CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS DISEASE. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY TWO TYPES OF CELLULAR INTERACTIONS IN THE CELLS THAT LINE SC USING A NEWLY DEVELOPED, ADVANCED 3D ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TECHNOLOGY.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY PETR BARANOV, MD, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016046) INDIRECT PHOTORECEPTOR NEUROPROTECTION THROUGH SMALL MOLECULE-INDUCED GROWTH FACTORS. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: WE AIM TO IDENTIFY SMALL MOLECULES THAT CAN INDUCE ENDOGENOUS GROWTH FACTORS IN THE SENSORY PART OF THE EYE THE RETINA. OUR OVERALL GOAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE POWER OF THIS INDIRECT NEUROPROTECTION APPROACH TO RESCUE PHOTORECEPTORS AND GANGLION CELLS FROM DEATH, OVERCOMING LIMITATIONS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH FACTOR DELIVERY. THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDIES SHOULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL, ACCESSIBLE AND EFFECTIVE MOLECULAR THERAPIES FOR RETINAL DYSTROPHIES AND OTHER NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY JIANHAI DU, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016047) NAD METABOLISM IN NORMAL AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC HUMAN RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIAL CELLS. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: SOME EYE DISEASES, LIKE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION, CAUSE BLINDNESS BECAUSE THE LIGHT-SENSING CELLS AND THEIR SUPPORT CELLS IN THE EYE STOP WORKING. WE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THE SUPPORT CELLS STOP WORKING IS BECAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO GENERATE ENERGY FOR THEMSELVES IS DAMAGED. WE WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS DAMAGE OCCURS AND TO TEST WHETHER NEW NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS, CALLED NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (NAD) METABOLITES, CAN IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO SURVIVE AND FUNCTION. IF THESE NEW SUPPLEMENTS CAN RESCUE THE SUPPORT CELLS WHEN STUDIED IN A CELL CULTURE DISH AND IN A MOUSE MODEL, WE BELIEVE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO SLOW OR STOP VISION LOSS IN PATIENTS WITH AMD AND OTHER SIMILAR RETINAL DISEASES.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY DEBASISH SINHA, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016056) MODULATING LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION IN RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIAL AS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACH FOR THE TREATMENT OF AMD. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS AMONG THE ELDERLY AND CURRENTLY THERE IS NO KNOWN TREATMENT FOR EARLY AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD). THEREFORE, WE WANT TO FOCUS OUR STUDIES AT THIS EARLY PHASE IN ORDER TO DEVELOP PREVENTION AND TREATMENT BEFORE THIS DISEASE ADVANCES AND CAUSES DRAMATIC VISION LOSS. OUR PROPOSED STUDIES ARE AIMED AT DEVELOPING NOVEL SMALL MOLECULES THAT COULD BE TESTED AS A THERAPY FOR EARLY AMD. SUCH STUDIES HAVE GREAT CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE SINCE THEY CAN PROVIDE A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACH FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF AMD.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY JEFFREY GROSS, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016067) A ZEBRAFISH MODEL OF AMD: A NOVEL APPROACH TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT FACILITATE RPE REGENERATION AND FUNCTIONAL RESTORATION. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: GEOGRAPHIC AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) RESULTS FROM THE PROGRESSIVE DEATH OF THE RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM (RPE), TRIGGERING PHOTORECEPTOR DEGENERATION IN THE RETINA AND ULTIMATELY, IN BLINDNESS; WE HAVE NO EFFECTIVE THERAPIES TO SLOW THE DEGENERATION OR RESTORE LOST RPE CELLS. IN CONTRAST TO MAMMALS, ZEBRAFISH POSSESS A REMARKABLE ABILITY TO REGENERATE LOST TISSUES AFTER INJURY, AND THEY ARE A HEAVILY UTILIZED MODEL SYSTEM FOR STUDYING THE PROCESS OF RETINAL REGENERATION. OUR RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT THEY CAN ALSO REPAIR DAMAGE TO THE RPE AND EXPERIMENTS PLANNED IN THIS PROPOSAL SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS BY IDENTIFYING CRITICAL FACTORS REQUIRED TO INITIATE AND SUSTAIN THE REGENERATIVE RESPONSE. ONCE WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE ZEBRAFISH ACHIEVES THIS DURING ITS NORMAL LIFESPAN, OUR FUTURE GOALS WILL BE TO DETERMINE WHY MAMMALS, LIKE US, ARE UNABLE TO REGENERATE RPE CELLS AND WHETHER ANY OF THE PATHWAYS THE ZEBRAFISH UTILIZES CAN BE REACTIVATED IN MAMMALS TO STIMULATE RPE REGENERATION AND THUS, RESTORE CELLS LOST IN AMD PATIENTS.

        <ExplanationTxt>NAME OF ORGANIZATION OR GOVERNMENT: UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER. (H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY FRANCESCO GIORGIANNI, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016068) IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES OF CD5L/AIM AS A POSSIBLE KEY ROLE PLAYER IN DRUSEN BIOGENESIS. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT CERTAIN CELLS OF THE EYE, TERMED RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM (RPE), THAT ARE TYPICALLY DAMAGED IN A COMMON DISEASE OF THE ELDERLY CALLED AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD), EXPRESS A PROTEIN THAT IS TARGETED BY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE AMD BY MEANS OF AUTO-ANTIBODIES. THIS PROTEIN WE DISCOVERED IN THE RPE IS CD5L/AIM, WHICH IS A SECRETED SCAVENGER RECEPTOR PROTEIN, AND WE HAVE EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT CD5L/AIM IS VERY IMPORTANT IN HELPING THE RPE CLEAR DAMAGED LIPOPROTEINS (CALLED OXLDL) THAT, IN AMD, ACCUMULATE UNDER THE RPE TO FORM DRUSEN, A DEPOSIT THAT IS THE FIRST AND MOST TYPICAL EVIDENCE THAT AN EYE HAS DEVELOPED AMD. THUS, WE WILL CULTURE RPE CELLS IN VITRO TO PROVE THAT CD5L/AIM IS A KEY MOLECULE IN CLEARING OXLDL AND THAT, WHEN BLOCKED BY AN ANTIBODY JUST LIKE WHAT WE SEE HAPPENS WITH AUTO-ANTIBODIES IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE AMD, THE RPE CELLS WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO CLEAR OXLDL. LASTLY, TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE PRESENCE OF AUTO-ANTIBODIES IN THE BLOODSTREAM OF PATIENTS WITH AMD RELATES TO DISEASE IN AFFECTED PATIENTS, WE WILL STUDY SERUM SAMPLES FROM AMD PATIENTS AND CORRELATE THE LEVELS OF ANTI-CD5L/AIM AUTO-ANTIBODIES WITH HOW MANY DRUSEN THEY HAVE AT THE BACK OF THEIR EYES, AS WELL AS WITH CERTAIN GENETIC FACTORS THAT ARE KNOWN TO INCREASE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING AMD. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO TEST THE HYPOTHESES THAT THE MORE AUTO-ANTIBODIES ONE HAS AGAINST CD5L/AIM, THE MORE DRUSEN WE ARE LIKELY TO FIND AT THE BACK OF THE EYE, WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT CERTAIN AUTO-ANTIBODIES FACILITATE FORMATION OF DRUSEN IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE AMD.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) IS A COMPLEX DISEASE LEADING TO IRREVERSIBLE BLINDNESS OF THE ELDERLY POPULATION IN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES. AT THE MOMENT, A FEW EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS EXIST FOR THIS DISEASE, BUT NEW TREATMENTS EFFECTIVE TO THE DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL CORRELATE IMAGING OF THE ATROPHIC LATE-STAGE LESION OF AMD DONOR EYES WITH FINDINGS WITH DETAILED MORPHOLOGICAL AND CELLULAR ANALYSIS IN AND AROUND THE LEADING EDGE OF THESE LESIONS.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY ZHIHONG HU, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016088) AUTOMATED MULTIMODAL DETECTION AND ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC ATROPHY. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: GEOGRAPHIC ATROPHY (GA) IS A FORM OF AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD), AND INCREASINGLY THE MAIN CAUSE OF VISION LOSS IN PATIENTS. MUCH OF THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH OF GA HAS FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL IMAGING MODALITIES, UTILIZING TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) INFORMATION ALONE. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE 3D TOPOLOGY OF THE DISEASE, UTILIZING INFORMATION FROM ALL IMAGING MODALITIES CONCOMITANTLY COULD POTENTIALLY YIELD A MORE PRECISE AND COMPREHENSIVE DEPICTION OF GA LESIONS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN AUTOMATED MULTIMODAL GA SEGMENTATION SYSTEM TO MORE PRECISELY QUANTIFY GA PROGRESSION OVER TIME IN MULTIMODAL 2D AND 3D IMAGES TO FACILITATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF GA'S RELATIONSHIP TO VISION LOSS.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY MARIA VALERIA CANTO-SOLER, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016119) A NOVEL 3D HUMAN MINI-RETINA MODEL FOR EARLY AMD. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: OUR STUDIES AIM AT UNCOVERING THE MECHANISMS THAT TRIGGER AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD), WITH THE PURPOSE OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THERAPEUTIC TREATMENTS FOR THIS CONDITION. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP THE FIRST "HUMAN RETINA IN A DISH" DERIVED FROM STEM CELLS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO RECREATE THE CELLULAR PHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL INTERACTIONS THAT OCCUR IN THE RETINA OF A PATIENT SUFFERING FROM EARLY STAGES OF AMD. THIS HUMAN AMD MODEL WOULD PROVIDE A UNIQUE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM TO INVESTIGATE THE INITIAL TRIGGERS LEADING TO THIS DISEASE AND TO DEVELOP TREATMENTS TO STOP ITS PROGRESS.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY MARCELO NOCIARI, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016124) LIPOFUSCIN-MEDIATED ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM STRESS IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF MACULAR DEGENERATION. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: AS RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM (RPE) GETS OLD, IT ACCUMULATES A LOT OF LIPID BISRETINOIDS (LBS). ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD, OR AFTER EXPOSURE TO LIGHT, LBS BECOME TOXIC AND MAY INDUCE CELL DEATH. MANY GROUPS HAVE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED MECHANISMS BY WHICH LBS DAMAGE THE RPE. THESE STUDIES, HOWEVER, DID NOT PROVIDE US WITH A METHOD TO CLEAR LBS OR ALLEVIATE THEIR HARMFUL EFFECTS. WORKING WITH CULTURES OF RPE CELLS AND SYNTHETIC LBS, WE FOUND A NOVEL MECHANISM BY WHICH LBS KILL RPE CELLS. THIS MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE CENTRAL TO LB TOXICITY AND IS AMENABLE TO INHIBITION WITH DRUGS, AS WE HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED TWO CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THAT FULLY PREVENT RPE CELL DEATH BY LBS. INTERESTINGLY, SOME OF THESE DRUGS ARE BEING TESTED FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEURODEGENERATION IN PARKINSON'S AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. IN THE CURRENT PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO CHARACTERIZE WELL THIS NEW DAMAGING MECHANISM, PROVE THAT IT CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO LB-INDUCED RETINAL DEGENERATION IN THE EYE, AND TEST IF DRUGS THAT BLOCK THIS MECHANISM CAN PREVENT BLINDNESS IN AN ANIMAL MODEL OF AMD.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: AGING IS AN IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD). AGING IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN TISSUE STIFFNESS. YET, WHETHER AND HOW PROGRESSIVE TISSUE STIFFENING CONTRIBUTES TO THE WORSENING OF THIS DEBILITATING AND DEGENERATIVE EYE DISEASE REMAINS UNKNOWN. THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BY USING AN INNOVATIVE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, SO THAT NEW AND POTENTIALLY SUPERIOR TREATMENTS CAN BE DEVELOPED TO TREAT THIS CONDITION IN THE FUTURE.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY KIP CONNOR, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016183) LIPID REGULATORS OF CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: IN WET OR NEOVASCULAR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD), ABNORMAL BLOOD VESSELS GROW FROM BENEATH THE RETINA THAT ARE IMMATURE IN NATURE AND LEAK FLUID BELOW OR WITHIN THE RETINA, LEADING TO A RAPID LOSS IN EYESIGHT. EMERGING DATA IMPLICATE LIPIDS DERIVED FROM THE CYTOCHROME P450 PATHWAY ACT AS POTENT REGULATORS OF ANGIOGENESIS. THUS, IT IS OF GREAT CLINICAL INTEREST TO ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE LIPID MEDIATORS FACILITATE DISEASE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR REGRESSION. OUR PROPOSAL HAS CLEAR POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO NEW THERAPEUTIC MOLECULES, TARGETS, AND STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFICALLY INHIBITING NEOVASCULAR AMD, A LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS IN THE ELDERLY WHICH, IF LEFT UNTREATED, RAPIDLY LEADS TO SUBSTANTIAL VISION LOSS.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY BIJU THOMAS, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016186) STUDIES ON FUNCTIONALITY OF IPS-RPE TRANSPLANTED IN IMMUNODEFICIENT RCS RATS. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: DYSFUNCTION AND DEATH OF RETINAL PIGMENT DPITHELIUM (RPE) HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN VARIOUS HUMAN RETINAL DEGENERATIVE DISEASES THAT LEAD TO BLINDNESS, SUCH AS AMD. WE PROPOSE TO TREAT SUCH DISEASES BY TRANSPLANTING A POLARIZED MONOLAYER OF RPE SHEETS DERIVED FROM HUMAN INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS (IPS). TO MINIMIZE THE IMMUNOLOGICAL REACTIONS, A NEWLY DEVELOPED RAT MODEL OF RETINAL DEGENERATION THAT DOES NOT REJECT HUMAN CELLS WILL BE USED FOR TESTING. IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF TRANSPLANTED RPE WILL BE CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH THAT IPS-RPE MONOLAYER TRANSPLANTATION IS A SUITABLE APPROACH TO TREAT VARIOUS DEGENERATIVE DISEASES AFFECTING THE EYE.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY MALIA EDWARDS, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016198) RETINAL GLIAL CHANGES IN AMD. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD), THE LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS IN PEOPLE OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE, IS A COMPLEX DISEASE THAT INVOLVES MANY CELLS. TWO CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED WITH REGARDS TO AMD ARE ASTROCYTES AND M LLER CELLS. SINCE THESE CELLS MAINTAIN A STABLE RETINAL ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNICATE WITH MANY CELLS, DISRUPTION TO THEIR NORMAL BEHAVIOR COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE AMD DISEASE PROCESS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE WHY ASTROCYTES EXIT THE RETINA IN AMD, POTENTIALLY IDENTIFYING NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY JOHN HULLEMAN, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016200) MANIPULATION OF A SINGLE GENE FOR THE TREATMENT OF MALATTIA LEVENTINESE AND DRY AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: MALATTIA LEVENTINESE (ML) AND AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) ARE TWO EYE DISEASES THAT DISRUPT THE NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE RETINA, THE BACK PORTION OF THE EYE WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SENSING LIGHT. IF THESE DISEASES ARE LEFT UNCHECKED, THEY CAN INTERFERE WITH A PERSON'S VISION, AND IN SOME CASES, RESULT IN BLINDNESS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REDUCE THE LEVELS OF A SINGLE PROTEIN WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF BOTH ML AND AMD. BY REDUCING THE LEVELS OF THIS PROTEIN, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY SLOW OR HALT DISEASE PROGRESSION.
